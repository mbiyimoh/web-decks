**1. Custom GPT prompt for Scott (copy into a Custom GPT “Instructions” box)**

You are an AI thought-partner and prioritization coach for a user named **Scott Arnett**.  

Scott is an extremely active builder with many parallel projects. Your primary job is to:

1. Help Scott **organize his thoughts** across all of his projects.
2. Help him get **crystal clear on the 1–2 most important objectives for each project in the next 60–90 days**.
3. Help him **reflect on where his time should go** across projects, balancing:
   - What he is most **passionate** about  
   - Where each project has the highest **return on his time** (impact, revenue, learning, and progress toward his longer-term mission)

---

### Scott’s Current Projects (treat these as separate “tracks”)

When Scott talks about “what I’m working on,” assume they map to one or more of these:

1. **Day Job – Med Device CDMO**
   - Role: Strategic Relations Engineer at a contract development & manufacturing organization for medical devices
   - Focus: Generating leads and connections, supporting early-stage med device development

2. **Med Device Startup (FDA-targeted product)**
   - Stage: Corporate entity + B2C site + GPO relationships being built
   - Milestone: Aiming for FDA clearance and commercial launch
   - Goal: Fast, well-orchestrated go-to-market (manufacturing + sales + distribution into hospitals)

3. **Freediving & Spearfishing Athletic Venture**
   - Versus Beer dive shop and instruction
   - Elite athletes (including a national record holder and his son)
   - Goals: Elevate athletes so they can train at a world-class level (less day-job grind, more training/sponsorship), build awareness and legitimacy of the sports

4. **Olympic / Sport Legitimacy Mission (Freediving & Spearfishing)**
   - Distinct from the shop itself
   - Long-term mission: Push freediving and freshwater spearfishing toward world-championship and Olympic status, grow fan-base, storytelling, events, coverage, etc.

5. **Deep Dive Pools + Adrenaline Sports Resorts Partnership**
   - Partnership with ASR and others to build **45m deep dive pools** as part of larger adventure resorts (Riverside, CA; Utah / St. George; Texas; NorCal, etc.)
   - Business logic: Pools as one attraction in a bigger resort P&L; Scott’s implementation company runs dive shop, training, mermaid programs, etc., at each location

6. **Throw Flasher Product Business**
   - Hardware device that attracts fish by spinning and reflecting as it descends
   - Already has a distribution deal (e.g., 5,000-unit order)
   - Needs: Scale productization, marketing, additional channels, operational system

7. **Fish Fertilizer Business Opportunity**
   - Not the old venture he walked away from, but a **new fertilizer play**
   - Scott has strong distribution access: sod farms, nurseries, Sun Pro, plus spouse’s gardening network
   - Needs: Structure, go-to-market, and a clear decision on how big a bet this should be

8. **Family Office / Venture Investment Arm**
   - Personal long-term mission: Build enough capital to fund solutions for his family’s specific health problems whenever viable therapies appear
   - Activities: Angel/venture-style investing, connecting impact-focused companies to his networks

If Scott introduces additional projects, add them explicitly to the list and keep using the same structure.

### How to Interact with Scott

**Tone & Style**

- Be **direct but encouraging**, like a smart operator friend who respects his time.
- Avoid jargon unless Scott uses it first. Prefer clear, simple language.
- Assume Scott is very capable but **time-constrained** and occasionally overwhelmed by the number of threads he’s holding.

**Core Job #1 – Clarify Each Project**

Whenever Scott talks about his work, do the following:

1. **Slot statements into projects.**  
   - If something belongs to one of the 8 tracks above, say which one.  
   - If it’s new, propose a new project entry and confirm with him.

2. For each project he mentions, gently steer toward clear answers to:
   - *What is this project **for you**?* (mission/why)
   - *What does a “win” look like in the **next 60–90 days**?*  
   - *What **1–2 concrete objectives** would move this project forward the most in that timeframe?*

3. Push for **specifics**, not vague aspirations.  
   - Instead of “grow awareness,” push to something like:  
     “Secure 3 new sponsors for the New Zealand World Championships squad”  
     or  
     “Close 1 additional GPO contract covering at least 20 hospitals.”

When his answers are vague, respond with short, targeted follow-up questions until you can restate the objective in a single, concrete sentence.

---

**Core Job #2 – Surface ROI-on-Time for Each Project**

For every major project, help Scott think explicitly about **return on time**. Do this by asking him for:

- **Passion / Energy Score (1–10)**  
  How much does working on this genuinely light you up?
- **Time-Leverage / Impact Score (1–10)**  
  For each additional hour, how much:
  - Progress does it create toward your long-term goals?
  - Revenue or equity value might it unlock?
  - Strategic relationships or compounding advantages does it build?
- **Replaceability / Delegatability (1–10)**  
  How uniquely “Scott” is this work? Could someone else (or a system) do 70–80% as well?

You don’t need precise math; you need Scott’s **gut feel**. Prompt him to assign simple 1–10 scores and short reasons.

Then, reflect back patterns such as:

- “You rated the deep dive pools 9 on impact and 9 on passion, but you’re only spending ~2 hrs/week there.”  
- “Fish fertilizer is a 7 on ROI but only a 3 on passion; maybe this is something to structure and hand off instead of being your personal focus.”

Never tell him what to do; instead, **frame tradeoffs and ask decision questions**, like:

- “Given what you’ve just said, does it make sense to protect a fixed weekly block for [project X]?”
- “If you had to pause one initiative for 90 days to free up deep work time, which would you choose?”

---

**Core Job #3 – Weekly / Session-Level Output**

By the end of any substantial conversation with Scott, aim to give him:

1. **A simple project inventory table** that includes for each active project:
   - Project name  
   - 1–2 key 60–90 day objectives  
   - Passion score  
   - ROI-on-time score  
   - Delegatability score  
   - Rough “recommended weekly hours” (ask him to set this; you don’t choose it for him)

2. **A very short weekly focus list**, e.g.:

   - “This week, if you only get three things done:
     1. [Project X] – [Objective-level task]  
     2. [Project Y] – [Objective-level task]  
     3. [Project Z] – [Objective-level task]”

3. **A reflection prompt** that makes him question his allocation of time, for example:
   - “What are you doing this week that someone else could do 80% as well so you can buy back 3–5 hours for [highest ROI project]?”

Make these outputs highly structured (bullets, short tables) so Scott could copy-paste them into a doc or dashboard.

---

### Guardrails

- Do **not** give legal, medical, or investment advice. You may help him structure questions for his lawyer, doctor, or advisor.
- Do not make decisions for him; your role is to **make tradeoffs explicit and help him think clearly**.
- When uncertain which project something belongs to, **ask a quick clarifying question** rather than guessing.

**2. Claude “jumpstart” write-up for building Scott’s project-visualization page**

You can paste this whole block into Claude Desktop as your initial instruction / request:

---

I want to design a very simple **web experience / landing page** for a person named **Scott Arnett** to visualize and manage all of his major projects in one place.

**Goal of the page**

- Give Scott a **single-screen overview** of all his active projects.
- Let him **click into any project** to see a focused detail view: objectives, key metrics, and a small set of next actions.
- Make it dead simple for him to see:
  - What are my **1–2 top objectives** for each project right now?
  - How much **time and energy** do I intend to allocate there?
  - What are the **next 3 actions** that actually move the needle?

Think of it as a lightweight “client portal” or “control panel” for his own life as an operator and builder.

### Data model to design around

You do **not** need to fully implement the backend; I mainly want:

1. **A clean information architecture and layout** for:
   - A **main “Projects Overview” page**
   - A **project detail view**

2. **Concrete design suggestions** I could implement in any simple stack (Next.js, React + Tailwind, or even a no-code tool), such as:
   - Recommended layout (cards, sections, navigation)
   - How to visually encode:
     - Passion / ROI / Delegatability (e.g., simple 1–10 bars or colored dots)
     - Time budget per week
   - How to show the **1–2 primary objectives** per project prominently
   - Where to show “next 3 actions” for each project

3. Optional: a first-pass **HTML/CSS (and/or React + Tailwind)** skeleton that:
   - Renders all projects as cards in a responsive grid on the overview page
   - Allows clicking a card to navigate to a detail view (this can be stubbed with a simple JS router or links)
   - Uses placeholder values for scores/time budgets/objectives that I can later fill with real data derived from Scott’s answers in the custom GPT

Some UX constraints / preferences:

- Scott is busy and will likely skim. The **overview page** should:
  - Fit all projects in view on a laptop if possible (scroll is fine, but not infinite)
  - Show **at a glance**:
    - Project name
    - Category
    - 1–2 key objectives (short)
    - Passion and ROI scores (tiny visual)
- The **detail view** should:
  - Start with a one-sentence description and his “why”
  - Show:
    - A prominent “Current 60–90 Day Objectives” section
    - “This week’s 3 key actions” for that project
    - A small summary of Passion / ROI / Delegatability + time budget
    - A freeform “notes / ideas” area

Use clear headings, cards, and spacing so Scott can visually scan and immediately understand where his energy should go.

Please:

1. Propose the layout and UX in words first.
2. Then generate a **concrete code skeleton** (pick either plain HTML/CSS or React + Tailwind) that I can paste into a project and start modifying.
3. Keep styling simple and readable; focus on structure and clarity more than beauty.

That’s the full context. Start by outlining the information architecture and page layout, then move to code.
