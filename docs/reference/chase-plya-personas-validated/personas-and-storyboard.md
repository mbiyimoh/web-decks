## PLYA Personas & Storyboards

**What it is:** An interactive artifact showing two core user personas (Jordan the Aspiring Athlete, Alex the Busy Professional) with detailed persona cards and 6-frame As-Is/To-Be storyboards for each.

**How to use:** Toggle between personas using the tabs at the top. Each view shows the full persona breakdown followed by two storyboards — the current struggle (As-Is) and the PLYA experience (To-Be).

### Persona Card Sections
- **Header** — Animated avatar, name, archetype, anchor quote
- **Quick Facts** — 4 key data points (time, discovery method, goals, etc.)
- **Jobs to Be Done** — What they're trying to accomplish
- **Pain Points** — Current frustrations
- **Emotional Needs + Sensitivities** — What they want to feel vs. what turns them off
- **What Makes Them Different** — Key differentiators from the other persona
- **PLYA Opportunity** — Strategic summary for product decisions

### Storyboards
- 6 frames per storyboard, all on one row for easy comparison
- Each frame has: number, emotion tag (color-coded), emoji illustration placeholder, title, description, thought bubble
- As-Is = red badge, shows the struggle
- To-Be = green badge, shows the transformed experience with PLYA
