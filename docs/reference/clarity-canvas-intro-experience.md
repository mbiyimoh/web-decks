if I was not a 33 strategies employee or a client with an existing client portal, I assume I just wouldn't
  be able to access the /clarity-canvas ecperience, is that correct? if so, what I'd like to do is create a
  function for myself that enalbes me to input an email and name here and it spins up a client account for
  that person in our database.
  1. then when they hit the /clarity-canvas page, they see an option for something like "First time here?
  Claim your client account." when they hit that...
  2. it asks purely for their email. after they input THAT...
  3. it takes them to the next screen where it says, "Welcome, [first name]." (large, welcome in white and
  their name in 3 3strategies gold). and then smaller below that, "We're excited to build with you. As you
  work with us and interact with the tools and experiences we've built for our clients, you'll be able to
  access all of those artifacts from your [dedicated client portal](link to their client portal page, open in
  a separate tab if clicked though)."
  4. then the main CTA on THAT page is "Proceed to Clarity Canvas", which takes you to a slightly tweaked
  version of the current welcome page:
  - instead of "Welcome, there" have that header read, "Let's get to know you [firstname]." (with the name in
  gold). and then the next line of text should read, "Your Clarity Canvas is a living map of who you are,
  what you're building, and where you're headed." you can keep the second line of helper text that's
  currently there as-is ("We'll start with a brain dump. Just talk freely about yourself, your work, and your
  goals. Our AI will extract and organize the insights.")
