lets just make it "= Shitty Output" for the 2nd one to keep it simple and consistent

the specifity problem should get its own slide with examples of how it manifests (eg. "why did it hardcode this instead of making it a variable?" because you never told it you wanted to extend the functionality in that way ... "why did it create a brand new function for such and such when one already exists?" because you never told it about / pointed it at / asked it to document the part of the codebase where that function exists).

"The ideate pipeline solves this..." should be "The spec-based workflow is designed to solve this by doing all the groundwork to make everything explicit ahead of time, presenting the plan to you at each step of its development so that nothing gets left to chance.

context is everything slide should have more examples. maybe for each there's a "see examples" button that opens our document viewer, but lets add a switcher WITHIN that docuemnt viewer component that would enable me to show provide MULTIPLE examples (eg. an instructions file from one of my customGPTs and at least one markdwon file from one of the claude sub-agents

where we have "Making Context Persistent" lets have some sort of header before that saying something like "theory to practice: making context persistent" (side-note, we should re-use this "theory to practice" concept repeatedly throughout the content to signify a moment where we're gonna show you how to actually apply the things we're teaching

for the purposes of this audience, 3 commandments would be better as a "PS" at the end of the deck if its worth including them at all. all I know is that the deck would flow much more naturally from "context is everything" directly into THE SPEC PIPELINE which is the most important takeaway of this piece of feedback

seems like the spec/create command / step of the process isnt included in the module at all for some reason? it should be
