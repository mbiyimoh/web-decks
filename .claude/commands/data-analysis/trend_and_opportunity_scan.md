Examine how the dataset changes over time.

## Analysis Requirements

- Identify inflection points, rising categories, or falling ones
- Surface potential opportunities: undervalued categories, overlooked niches, or fast-growing areas
- Frame findings as if advising a founder evaluating the graded magazine secondary market

## Output Format

Provide charts, stats, and 2–3 strategic recommendations.

## Steps

1. Analyze temporal patterns in the data (price trends, listing volume over time, etc.)
2. Identify categories or segments showing growth or decline
3. Spot potential market inefficiencies or opportunities
4. Generate strategic recommendations based on findings
5. Create time-series visualizations and supporting charts
6. Frame insights in terms of actionable business opportunities
7. **MANDATORY DATA VALIDATION CHECK**:
   - Audit every trend claim (growth rate, decline, inflection point)
   - Verify trend calculations show actual data points, not just fitted lines
   - Disclose data limitations (e.g., "single-date snapshot, no temporal trends possible")
   - Check that opportunity sizing uses real data, not speculative projections
   - Flag any ROI calculations with underlying assumptions and sensitivity analysis
   - Trace all "undervalued segment" claims back to concrete price/volume data
   - Ensure recommendations are based on reproducible analysis, not intuition
   - Add "Data Sources & Methodology" section with all queries and calculations
   - Validate that another analyst could verify every opportunity identified
