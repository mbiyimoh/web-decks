# Research-Driven Debug (Generic Command)

## Step 1 — Issue Summary
Write a detailed summary of the issue as you currently understand it, based on all available logs, symptoms, behaviors, configuration details, and contextual clues. The goal is to produce a clear problem statement that someone unfamiliar with the situation could follow.

## Step 2 — External Research
Use the issue summary as a prompt to conduct targeted external research aimed at:

1. **Understanding the general class of system involved**  
   (e.g., deployment environments, hosting paradigms, runtime infrastructure, networking models, build/launch behavior, etc.)

2. **Understanding how systems of this type typically interact with applications like ours**  
   Including common configurations, expected behaviors, frequent pitfalls, best practices, and debugging conventions.

3. **Investigating the specific issue we are encountering**, covering:  
   - Known causes  
   - Known fixes or workarounds  
   - Examples of similar issues encountered by others  
   - Relevant documentation or expert commentary  
   - Remaining uncertainty or areas needing further exploration  

## Step 3 — Findings Summary
Write a clear and well-structured summary of all findings from your research. Organize it so that someone ramping up on this system or problem space could quickly understand the context, the mechanics, and the root considerations.

## Step 4 — Documentation Updates
Recommend a set of additions or updates to our project documentation to preserve the key lessons learned. These should reinforce the project’s “institutional memory.” Examples include:

- Architectural or configuration clarifications  
- Common troubleshooting flows  
- Gotchas or recurring caveats  
- Explanations of system behaviors or constraints  
- Newly discovered requirements or best practices  

## Step 5 — Solution Recommendation
Provide a recommended path forward, including:

- The most likely root cause  
- Step-by-step actions to resolve the issue  
- Follow-up tasks, monitoring, or verification steps  
- Optional improvements or safeguards to prevent similar issues in the future
